3. 'comments' table should have 'event_id' 'name' 'comment'.
4. Create .env file in the server with environment variable DATABASE_URL=[yourURL]
5. In server folder, run npm i
6. In client folder, run npm install; npm run build
7. Replace render links with localhost:8080 or your server.
8. In client and server, use npm run dev.
