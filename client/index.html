          Welcome to The Town Hall. The Town Hall is a way to keep track and
          schedule events that are upcomming in your local community. Events
          range from theatrical performances to social groups to conventions
          (and everything imbetween). You can find public hosted events on our
          main page below, and have the tools to organize your own!
        </p>
        <p>
          Why an online app? In the modern day, social isolation has proven to
          be a significant problem and more and more individuals are opting to
          be more online than ever before - this is both a pro and a con.
          Psychologists have proven for decades that human beings are social
          creatures, and our wellbeing craves social connection and
          interpersonal relationships. Being more and more online can limit
          people's wellbeing especially when it becomes a bigger dependant
          factor. So, why not have an app to help residents of your local
          community find a reason to get together and get that necessary social
          connection? That is the heart of community after all, and a village
          without its occupants is a derelict ruin. So, feel free to scroll
          what's happening in your local community, make friends, stay in touch
          and keep people connected!
        </p>
        <p>Happy grouping!</p>
